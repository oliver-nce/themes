# Theme System — Documentation Index

This folder explains HOW the theme system works. For the catalog of available classes, see `/THEME_CLASS_CONTRACT.json` or `/docs/theme-classes-reference.md` instead.

**Read this INDEX first. Then read ONLY the one file relevant to your question. Do NOT bulk-load this folder.**

## ThemeSwatchPicker (shipped widget)

Reusable picker that writes a single `theme-{kind}-{role}-{shade}` class string to a bound form field (e.g. Page Panel `header_color`). Does **not** emit hex or custom colors — distinct from the hex `SwatchPicker.vue` in the theme editor.

| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| Full spec (layout, API, embed targets, verification) | `../theme-swatch-picker.md` |
| Agent handoff (current state, next tasks) | `../handoff-theme-swatch-picker.md` |
| DOM core | `frontend/src/widget/theme-swatch-picker-core.ts` |
| Vue wrapper | `frontend/src/components/ThemeSwatchPicker.vue` |
| Desk API | `await frappe.ui.themeSwatchPicker.open({ frm, themeField, valueField })` — **`themeField` = Link doc name → slug lookup** |
| Slug resolver (Desk) | `frontend/src/widget/adapters/desk-adapter.ts` → `resolveNceThemeSlug()` |
| Standalone API | `window.themeSwatchPicker.open({ themeFieldEl, valueFieldEl })` — **element value must be slug** |
| Build | `npm run build:widget` → `themes/public/dist/` (gitignored; run on deploy) |
| Desk assets | `hooks.py` — `app_include_js` + widget CSS |

**Assumption:** `nce_theme.css` is published on the site (`publish_theme()` on save of Active/base themes). Swatches paint via `theme-bg-*` classes inside a `data-nce-theme="{slug}"` wrapper — zero color math in the widget. On Desk, `themeField` holds the **NCE Theme link** (doc name); the adapter looks up **`slug`** before scoping the modal (Page Panel `theme`, not the slug string).

**Agent — Vue embed save path:** `ThemeSwatchPicker.vue` does not call `frm.set_value`. Downstream apps that save via reactive `formData` (e.g. NCE Events `usePanelFormDialog`) **must** pass `:set-field` / `:get-field` bound to that object or the pick will not persist. See `../theme-swatch-picker.md` §8.1.
